# SPEC: 0.2.0 Unattended booking

## Goal
Book a court at the moment the app opens bookings (06:00 every day) without anyone at the
computer. Windows Task Scheduler starts `court-booker` at 05:45; it starts MuMu, connects ADB,
restarts the Vinhomes app, waits on the utilities list ("Sân Tennis"), and at the exact start
time books the configured slots for today + `days_ahead` (default 2). Speed at the start time is
the only performance goal: everything slow happens before it. After the run, MuMu and the app
are left open.

## Flow of one scheduled run
1. **Start-up:** load config, add a daily log file, keep Windows awake, resolve the start time,
   measure the clock offset (NTP).
2. **Emulator:** `MuMuManager.exe info -v <index>`; if `is_android_started` is false, run
   `control -v <index> launch` and poll until true (`boot_timeout`).
3. **ADB:** find `adb`, reuse or start the server, connect to the serial MuMu reports
   (`adb_host_ip:adb_port`) or to `device` from config.
4. **App:** stop and start `com.vinhomes.resident`; wait for "Tiện ích" or "Sân Tennis".
5. **Wait:** go to the utilities list and wait until the corrected clock reaches the start time.
6. **Book:** one round per slot (the 0.1.0 flow); if the date or slot is not open yet, re-enter
   the calendar until `open_retry_seconds` have passed.
7. **Report:** summary to console, log file and optional Telegram message; exit code.

## Out of scope
Specific `--date`, cancellation or a stop button, structured progress events, any API or UI,
closing MuMu or the app after the run, waking from shutdown, automating login or OTP, starting
emulators other than MuMu, bypassing the developer-mode check (assumed to work for this
release), tests against a real emulator, Task Scheduler or network in CI.

## Interfaces
- **Errors** (`errors.py`): base `CourtBookerError`. `BookingError` (aborts one round; adds
  `BookingNotOpenError`); `RequestError` (bad arguments or config; `ConfigError` derives from
  it); `DeviceError` → `EmulatorError`, `AdbNotFoundError`, `NoDeviceError`,
  `MultipleDevicesError(serials)`, `DeviceConnectionError`; `AppNotReadyError`.
- **Runner** (`runner.py`): `RoundResult`; `connect_device(config)` (emulator, ADB,
  uiautomator2); `run_booking(device, config, *, dry_run, start=None, offset=0.0, results)`
  prepares the app, waits for `start`, books every slot and appends to `results`, so the CLI
  can print finished rounds after Ctrl+C.
- **Emulator** (`emulator.py`): `MuMu(manager, index, run=..., clock=..., sleep=...)` with
  `info()`, `is_started()`, `adb_serial()`, `launch()`, `ensure_started(timeout)`. Accepts both
  the single-object and the index-keyed JSON of `info`. Missing manager or boot timeout raises
  `EmulatorError`. `mumu_manager = ""` skips this step.
- **ADB** (`adb.py`): `find_adb(adb_path, extra_dirs)` (config `adb_path`, then `PATH`, then
  MuMu's own `adb.exe`); `Adb(path, run, probe)` with `ensure_server()` (reuse port 5037 if it
  answers, else `start-server`), `devices()`, `connect(serial)`, `discover(ports)`;
  `resolve_device(adb, device, preferred, timeout)`. `device = "auto"` uses MuMu's serial if
  known, else attached devices, else a port scan (7555, 16384, 16416, 16448, 5555, 5557, 5559,
  62001; closed ports are skipped). An explicit serial is connected alone and retried until
  `timeout`.
- **Flow** (`flow.py`): `Booker.prepare(restart)` stops and starts the app (or starts it only if
  not in front), waits for home or utilities, ends on the utilities list, raises
  `AppNotReadyError`. `Booker.open_slot(slot, target)` re-enters the calendar while the date or
  slot is missing, until `open_retry_seconds`; "Hết chỗ" fails at once.
- **Clock** (`clock.py`): `resolve_start(text, now, grace)` (today at `HH:MM[:SS]`; up to
  `grace` late starts now with a warning; later raises `RequestError`); `ntp_offset(server)`
  (`None` on failure); `wait_until(target, offset, now, sleep)` sleeps coarsely, then in
  millisecond steps.
- **Power** (`power.py`): `keep_awake()` uses `SetThreadExecutionState`; no-op off Windows.
- **Logging** (`logging_setup.py`): `add_file_handler(log_dir)` writes
  `court-booker-YYYY-MM-DD.log`; the console handler is skipped when there is no console
  (`pythonw.exe`).
- **Notify** (`notify.py`): `send_telegram(token, chat_id, text, post=...)`, never raises.
- **Schedule** (`schedule.py`): `build_task_xml(...)` (daily trigger at `wake_at`, `WakeToRun`,
  interactive user, runs `pythonw.exe -m court_booker --config <abs> --scheduled`);
  `install`, `remove`, `status` call `schtasks`.
- **Config** (new keys, in the dataclass and `config.example.toml`): `device = "auto"`,
  `adb_path = ""`, `mumu_manager`, `mumu_index = 0`, `boot_timeout = 180`,
  `restart_app = true`, `start_at = "06:00"`, `wake_at = "05:45"`,
  `ntp_server = "time.google.com"`, `open_retry_seconds = 60`, `log_dir = "logs"`,
  `telegram_token = ""`, `telegram_chat_id = ""`. Relative paths resolve against the config
  file's folder.
- **CLI:** `court-booker [--at HH:MM[:SS] | --scheduled] [--dry-run] ...`; without either flag
  it books immediately. `court-booker schedule install|remove|status [--config]`. Exit codes:
  0 all rounds ok · 1 a round failed · 2 bad arguments or config · 3 emulator or ADB error ·
  4 app not ready · 130 Ctrl+C (summary still printed).

## Implementation steps
Each step is a branch stacked on the previous one, with tests, green `pytest` and `ruff`.

## Verification
- `python -m pytest -q` with fakes only (device, subprocess runner, port probe, clock, HTTP).
- `python -m ruff check .` and `python -m ruff format --check .`
- Manual, by the user, after steps 3–6: `court-booker --dry-run` with MuMu closed; then
  `court-booker --at <now + 3 min> --dry-run`; after step 10, `court-booker schedule install`
  and one scheduled `--dry-run` morning.
- Before one 06:00 opening, dump the calendar with `tools/inspect_screen.py` to see how a
  not-yet-open date or slot looks; tune step 7 in 0.3.0 if needed.

## Windows setup (documented in README)
PC on or in Sleep (not shut down); plugged in; "Allow wake timers" enabled; Windows stays
signed in (screen may be off or locked; MuMu needs the session); the Vinhomes app stays logged
in inside MuMu.
