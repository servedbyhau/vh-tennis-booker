# Contributing

## Setup

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
```

`pre-commit` runs Ruff (lint and format) and basic file checks on every commit.

## Before opening a pull request

```bash
ruff check .
ruff format .
pytest
```

If the booking flow changed, also run `court-booker --dry-run --verbose` against the emulator.

## Conventions

- **Language:** code, comments, logs, commit messages and documentation are in English.
  Accessibility labels of the target app stay in Vietnamese and live in `config.toml`.
- **Style:** enforced by Ruff (line length 100). Public functions have type hints and a
  one-line docstring in the imperative mood. Comments explain *why*, not *what*.
- **Errors:** raise a subclass of `BookingError` for failures that should abort one round.
- **Logging:** use the module logger (`logging.getLogger(__name__)`), never `print`, except
  for the final summary in the CLI.
- **Commits:** follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/),
  e.g. `feat: add retry when a slot is not yet open`, `fix: wait for ticket screen`.
- **Branches:** each version is prepared on `release/X.Y.Z`, cut from `main`. Work happens
  on `feat/<topic>`, `fix/<topic>` or `docs/<topic>` branches cut from the release branch
  and merged back into it via pull request, one PR per branch. `main` only receives the
  release branch when everything in it is stable.
- **Merging:** use "Create a merge commit"; do not squash or rebase, so commits keep their
  identity across branches.
- **Versioning:** [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Record changes in
  `CHANGELOG.md` under "Unreleased" and move them to a version section when releasing.
- **Privacy:** never commit screenshots, UI dumps or `config.toml`.

## Releasing

1. Start the version from `main`:
   ```bash
   git switch -c release/X.Y.Z main
   git push -u origin release/X.Y.Z
   ```
2. For each change, branch from `release/X.Y.Z` and open a pull request into it.
3. When the release branch is stable, on a branch from it update `__version__` in
   `src/court_booker/__init__.py` (`pyproject.toml` reads it from there), move the
   "Unreleased" entries in `CHANGELOG.md` to a new version section, and commit with
   `chore: release vX.Y.Z`; merge it into the release branch.
4. Open one pull request `release/X.Y.Z` → `main` and merge it with a merge commit.
5. Tag the merge commit on `main` and push the tag:
   ```bash
   git switch main && git pull
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```
6. Create a GitHub release from the tag using the changelog entry, then delete the
   release branch.
