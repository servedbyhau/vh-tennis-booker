Books a sports court in the **Vinhomes Resident** app the moment bookings open, while its
owner sleeps.

**The problem.** The app opens each day's courts at 06:00, and the popular slots are gone
within seconds. Booking by hand means being awake, and fast, every morning.

**The approach.** A Windows scheduled task wakes the PC shortly before 06:00, starts the MuMu
Player Android emulator and taps through the app's own booking screens, as a person would.
Python reads each screen in one accessibility dump and finds every button by its label; a
small Android instrumentation driver written for the project does the taps, with
uiautomator2 as a fallback. It uses no private API and does not modify the app.

**The result.** It has booked real courts at 06:00 since 2026-10-10. On 2026-11-01,
two MuMu instances booked four slots in parallel, at Origami and BS; each first slot reached
its ticket within five seconds. Beside the booking engine there is a local FastAPI backend
and a React and TypeScript web UI, in Vietnamese and English, for the settings, the schedule
and the history of every run.

It books tennis and the other courts a subdivision offers (multi-purpose, volleyball, table
tennis, basketball, football, pickleball, badminton), for the Origami and BS subdivisions so
far. It installs as a desktop app (one installer, no Python needed), which also sets the
daily task; the command line and a browser still work for development.

through, and each step as it happens; the History is beside it](docs/img/running.png)

## Highlights

- **Unattended and on time.** The PC wakes from sleep, and the run keeps NTP time on a
  counter Windows does not set, so the first tap goes out 0.1 s after 06:00:00.
- **One read per screen.** Each screen is one accessibility dump (about 13 ms) searched
  locally, so waiting for a screen and finding its button cost the same single read.
- **Reports only what the app showed.** A slot counts as booked only once the app shows its
  ticket (the booking confirmation); otherwise the round fails with the app's own message,
  or as "outcome unknown", never as booked.
- **Built for a slow app and a fragile emulator.** A tap the app ignores is repeated, a slow
  screen is awaited up to 30 s, and a frozen emulator ends the run after 60 s instead of
  hanging until the next morning.
- **Several accounts at once.** Each extra MuMu instance books with its own account, court
  and slots, in a process of its own, so one that fails holds up no other.
- **Tested without a device.** Fakes replace the emulator, ADB, the clock and Task
  Scheduler; CI runs Ruff, pytest on Python 3.9 to 3.14, and the UI's checks, tests and
  build.

## How it works

```mermaid

    A["Home: tap Tiện ích"] --> B["Utilities: tap the sport's tile, e.g. Sân Tennis"]
    B --> C["Calendar: pick the date and slot, tap Tiếp tục"]
    C --> V["Venues (Chọn phân khu), if shown: tap the venue"]

    E --> F["Confirmation: tick the consent, tap Xác nhận"]
    F --> G["Ticket: booked"]
    G -->|Back, next slot| B
```

The app is built with Flutter, which publishes its widgets to Android's accessibility tree
with their text in `content-desc`. The booker reads each screen in one dump, finds the
buttons by their labels, and the driver finds them again in the current tree before
clicking. Coordinates distinguish duplicate labels and locate unlabelled controls; the
uiautomator2 fallback taps the points from the dump. A page with a single choice (one
venue, one court) passes on to the next by itself, and the booker goes on from whichever
page it reads. Each slot in `config.toml` is booked
in its own round, and one Back from the ticket returns to the utilities list for the next
one. The app may be set to Vietnamese or
English: the booker tells which from the first screen and uses that language's labels. The
Vietnamese labels live in `config.toml`, so a change of wording in the app needs no code
change; the English ones are built in.

A real 06:00 run, abridged (times are the PC clock, which was 0.161 s behind: the first
tap went out at 06:00:00.001 and is logged once the calendar showed):

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Windows (used on Windows 11) with [MuMu Player](https://www.mumuplayer.com/); ADB ships
  with MuMu
- The Vinhomes Resident app installed in MuMu and logged in
- Python 3.9 or later
- Node.js 22.12 or later, only for the web UI

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/servedbyhau/vh-tennis-booker.git
cd vh-tennis-booker
pip install -e ".[app]"            # "app" adds the backend of the web UI
cp config.example.toml config.toml
```

If `court-booker` is not found afterwards (Python's `Scripts` folder is not on `PATH`), use
`python -m court_booker` instead.

### 2. Configure

Edit `config.toml`, or later use Settings in the web UI. The keys you usually change:

| Key | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `slots` | `["18:00 - 19:00", "19:00 - 20:00"]` | Slots to book, one round each, in this order: put the most wanted first |
| `sport` | `"tennis"` | What to book: `tennis`, `multi`, `volleyball`, `table-tennis`, `basketball`, `football`, `pickleball` or `badminton` |
| `court` | `"S10 - Sân tennis"` | The court, as the app names it (S6, S8, S9 or S10 for tennis at Origami; BE7 or BCX3/CX2 01-02 at BS) |
| `subdivision` | `""` | The account's subdivision, `origami` or `bs`; empty follows the account. The run books by `court` either way |
| `start_at` | `"06:00"` | When the app opens bookings |
| `wake_at` | `"05:45"` | When the daily task wakes the PC and starts preparing |

Everything else (the app's labels, timeouts, the MuMu folder) has a working default,
explained in `config.example.toml`.

To book with more accounts at once, clone the MuMu instance in MuMu's multi-instance manager,
log the clone in to another account, and add an `[[instances]]` table for it (example in
`config.example.toml`): its `mumu_index`, and any of `slots`, `subdivision`, `sport`, `court` and
`venue_keyword` that differ. The web UI shows a tab for each machine on top of the
ticket, with its own settings and its own setup; "Máy 2" (MuMu 1) is always there, and its
"Dùng máy này" switch adds or removes its `[[instances]]` table.

### 3. Set up the PC and the emulator

```bash
court-booker setup                         # check MuMu, its screen, wake timers and the app
court-booker setup --auto                  # fix by hand what the runs and schedule fix
court-booker setup --auto --restart-mumu   # also restart a running MuMu to apply its screen
```

Nothing here is needed before a run: each run finds MuMu when `mumu_manager` points
elsewhere (without rewriting `config.toml`) and sets the screen of a stopped MuMu to
540x1600 at 220 DPI before starting it (the whole slot list then fits without scrolling; a
running MuMu with another screen is only logged). Switching the schedule on allows wake
timers on mains and battery. `setup --auto` also saves the MuMu folder to `config.toml`.
The rest is up to you:

- Keep the app logged in inside MuMu.
- Leave the PC on or in **Sleep**: a PC that is shut down cannot be woken.
- Keep it plugged in.
- Stay signed in to Windows (a locked screen is fine): MuMu needs the desktop session.

### 4. Try a dry run

```bash
court-booker --dry-run --at 14:05     # a time a few minutes from now
```

A dry run walks the whole flow and stops before "Xác nhận", so nothing is booked. Close MuMu
first to test the whole chain, as at 06:00. Exit code 4 usually means the app is logged
out.

### 5. Book every morning

```bash
court-booker schedule install   # daily task at wake_at; it books for real at start_at
court-booker schedule status    # the task, its last and next run
```

The ticket's "Auto-book" switch in the web UI does the same, once a dry run has passed.
`court-booker schedule remove` deletes the task. A real run closes MuMu once its rounds are
done; the next run starts it again. A dry run leaves it open.

## Web UI

```bash
court-booker serve --config config.toml   # backend on http://127.0.0.1:8765, API docs at /api/docs
cd ui && npm ci && npm run dev            # then open http://localhost:5173
```

`--config config.toml` makes the UI read and save the same file as the command line. The
backend listens on 127.0.0.1 only, and the 06:00 run does not need it; watching a run in
the UI does not slow it down. Vietnamese is the default language, English is one click
away.

The UI is one screen, without a menu:

- **The line at the top** says whether the next start is ready, or the one thing to do first.
- **The ticket** on the left, a card drawn like a ticket, is the next booking in two parts:
  on top the daily switch (it creates or removes the Windows task, once a dry run passed)
  and what is set, the play day, court and slots; below, the subdivision, the sport, the
  court and up to two slots to choose, saved on each press, and a dry run. During a run it
  shows the steps as they happen.
- **Lịch sử / History** on the right: each run in two lines, its play day, court and count
  ("2/2"), then every slot booked or not and when it started (real bookings, dry runs on
  request); one click opens the reasons, the steps and the technical log.
- **Thiết lập / Setup** beside it: the steps only you can do (install MuMu and the Vinhomes
  app, log in), ticked by you, and a short guide; MuMu's place and screen and waking the PC
  need no step (the runs and the daily switch see to them). It
  opens first, with a count, while anything is left. The Windows notification switch sits on
  the ticket, beside the daily switch.

Saving settings rewrites `config.toml` (its comments are dropped); the next run reads it.

## Command line

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `court-booker` | Book the slots in `config.toml` now |
| `court-booker --dry-run` | Walk the whole flow and stop before "Xác nhận" |
| `court-booker --at 06:00` | Prepare now, start booking at 06:00:00 |
| `court-booker --scheduled` | The same at `start_at` (what the daily task runs) |
| `court-booker --slots "18:00 - 19:00"` | Other slots, for this run only |
| `court-booker --verbose` | Also print every screen read and every tap |
| `court-booker --driver instrumentation` / `--driver uiautomator2` | Use only that driver; the default `auto` tries instrumentation, then falls back to uiautomator2 |
| `court-booker setup [--auto]` | Check the PC and the emulator, or fix them |
| `court-booker schedule install` / `status` / `remove` | The daily task |
| `court-booker serve --config config.toml` | The backend of the web UI |

Every command takes `--config` (default: `config.toml` in the current folder; for `serve`,
the one in the data folder).

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | every round succeeded |
| 1 | a round failed |
| 2 | bad arguments or config, the start time has passed, or a dry run around the scheduled run |
| 3 | emulator or ADB error, or the emulator stopped answering (frozen) |
| 4 | the app did not reach its home screen (for example, logged out) |
| 5 | another run holds the run lock |
| 130 | interrupted with Ctrl+C |

- **Logs**: each run appends to `logs/court-booker-YYYY-MM-DD.log` beside `config.toml`,
  with every screen it read and every tap; each other MuMu instance to its own
  `…-mumuN.log`.
- **Data folder**: the history database `booker.db` and the run lock `run.lock` (and
  `run-mumuN.lock` for each other instance) are in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CourtBooker`; set
  `COURT_BOOKER_HOME` to move them.
- **One run at a time**: a second run is refused (exit code 5), and the scheduled run waits
  for a run already going, then stops it two minutes before the start time. No dry run or
  auto setup starts from `wake_at` to five minutes after `start_at`.

## Roadmap

The 0.x versions go through four phases toward 1.0.0: it runs, it handles every situation,
it is fast, it is friendly to use. Released: 0.19.0 ([changelog](CHANGELOG.md)), the desktop
app with its installer, which books every morning. Left before 1.0.0: finishing the packaging.
See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).
