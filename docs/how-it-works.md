# How it works

## Reading a Flutter app from the outside

uiautomator2 reads Android's accessibility tree. Flutter renders its own widgets, but
publishes a *semantics* tree to accessibility services, where visible text appears in
`content-desc` (not `text`). Every element is therefore matched by its `content-desc`
label (`screen.Match`).

Each screen is read with **one hierarchy dump**, which returns every element with its
visible bounds in about 70 ms, no slower than a query for a single element. Elements are
then matched locally (`screen.Screen`), so a screen costs one device command however many
elements the step needs.

Two consequences of Flutter shaped the design:

1. **Only on-screen widgets exist.** Flutter builds lazily, so a time slot below the
   fold is absent from the tree until scrolled into view, and dump bounds are clipped to
   what is shown. At 540x1600 the whole slot list fits; on shorter screens
   `Booker.select_slot` swipes until the slot is mostly visible above the sticky bottom
   button, reading the screen until the list stops moving.
2. **Unlabeled widgets.** The consent checkbox is a plain clickable `View` with no
   label and `checkable=false`. It is located relative to its caption:

   ```
   [35,1323][79,1367]   View  clickable=true      <- checkbox
   [79,1322][313,1355]  View  "Tôi đã hiểu và đồng ý với "
   ```

   A candidate is accepted only if it is small, left of the caption and on the same
   row (`geometry.is_checkbox_beside`). Thresholds scale with screen width.

## "Coordinates" vs. elements

Every tap on Android is ultimately a touch at (x, y). The difference is where the point
comes from: here it is taken from the latest dump of the screen, never stored across
screens. Waiting for the next screen and locating the next element are the same read, so
pre-recorded coordinates would not save a command: the screen must be read anyway to know
it has appeared.

## Navigation

`Booker.tap_and_advance()` taps an element of the current dump, then reads the screen every
20 ms until a finder returns what the next step needs (for example the target day). If the
next screen does not appear within 2 s (tap swallowed by lag), it taps again while the
element is still shown, up to 5 times. Two seconds before the start time the utilities
list is read once more, so the first command at the start time is the tap itself.

After confirming, the script waits until the confirmation screen is gone (the ticket
screen is shown). From the ticket screen, one Back returns to the utilities list, where
the next round begins.

## Lessons learned

- The first coordinate-based version failed because the emulator ran at **540×960**,
  not the assumed 900×1600. Label-based lookup removed the whole class of bugs.
- Count round trips, not lines of code. uiautomator2's `click()` on a selector waits for
  the element and reads its bounds before tapping; together with an explicit `wait()` a
  tap cost four commands. Reading a whole screen once is as cheap as one of them.
- `window_size()` reported (960, 540) while MuMu ran a tablet resolution with the app in
  portrait; the screen size is now taken from the dump.
- Measure before optimizing: every log line shows the time elapsed since the previous step,
  and the debug log counts device commands per round.
