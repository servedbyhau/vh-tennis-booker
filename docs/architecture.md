# Architecture

Three parts: the **engine** (`engine.py` says how to start it: `python -m court_booker`, or the
packaged app's own exe) books a court in a run of its own; the
**backend** (`court_booker.api`, FastAPI) serves the app's screens; the **UI** (`ui/`, React)
is those screens. The 06:00 task runs the engine alone. How the flow reads the app:
[how-it-works.md](how-it-works.md); facts about the app and MuMu: [field-notes.md](field-notes.md);
the desktop app's design and the packaging still to do: [specs/0.5.0-desktop-app.md](specs/0.5.0-desktop-app.md).
Details live in the docstrings; this page says where things are and what must stay true.

## Engine: one run

- `cli.py` parses the arguments (`schedule ...` goes to `schedule.main`), applies them onto
  `Config`, adds the log file, measures the clock, and inside `power.keep_awake()` takes the run
  lock, connects the device and runs the rounds. Errors map to exit codes (`RequestError` 2,
  `DeviceError` 3, `AppNotReadyError` 4, `LockHeldError` 5, Ctrl+C 130; a failed round 1). On
  every path it logs the summary, records the run, sends the optional Telegram summary and the
  Windows notification (`notify.py`; a failure only logs a warning). After a real run with at
  least one round, `close_emulator` shuts MuMu down.
- Other MuMu instances (`[[instances]]` in the config, each with its own account and its own
  `mumu_index`, `slots`, `subdivision`, `sport`, `court`, `venue_keyword`;
  `config.instance_config`):
  the run's process, once it holds the lock and has cleared stale runs, starts one process per
  entry (`start_instances`: the same command with `--instance N`, without `--slots`,
  `--device`; console output dropped) and waits for them, holding its lock. Each such process
  is a whole run of its own with its instance's settings: its lock `run-mumu<N>.lock`, its log file
  `court-booker-<date>-mumu<N>.log`, its history run, its notification titled "MuMu N · …"
  (the first instance's too, as "MuMu 0"); it never clears stale runs. So an instance that
  fails or freezes holds up no other. Several instances need `mumu_manager` and
  `device = "auto"`; otherwise, or for an entry repeating an instance, the run books with its
  own instance alone (warning). Each run's `run_started` names its instance as `device`.
- `lock.py` + `processes.py`: the run lock `run.lock` in the data folder (pid and process start
  time, so a reused pid is never taken for the holder). A scheduled run takes over a holder
  2 minutes before the start; a stale lock is cleared. The quiet time refuses a dry run or auto
  setup from `wake_at` to start + 5 min.
- `runner.connect_device`: start MuMu (`emulator.py`, MuMuManager), find adb and the serial
  (`adb.py`), then the instrumentation driver (`driver.py`), falling back to uiautomator2 when
  it does not start (not after a freeze). `--driver` picks one. Every device call runs on one
  worker thread (`watchdog.py`) and fails with `DeviceNotRespondingError` after 60 s; the run
  then ends (exit 3, through `os._exit`, as a stuck thread could hold the exit).
- `runner.run_booking`: `prepare()` (animations and notification banners off in one shell
  command, app restarted, home screen), wait until
  `start - warm_up_seconds`, measure the clock again, open the utilities list (`locate_entry`),
  read it again 2 s before the start, wait until start + 0.1 s, then one round per slot.
  A `BookingError` fails its round only, except: `DeviceNotRespondingError` ends the run after
  its round, and `QuotaFullError` leaves the rounds left unrun ("Skipped: the booking quota is
  used up", no device command). A failure logs the last screen read (`log_last_screen`).
- `clock.py`: NTP (the configured server, then fallbacks; the answer with the shortest round
  trip) anchored on `time.perf_counter()`, so Windows setting the PC clock during the wait
  changes nothing. Without an answer it is the PC clock, with a warning.

## Engine: the booking flow (`flow.Booker`)

- `screen.Screen` is one `dump_hierarchy` parsed into `Node`s (label, visible bounds,
  clickable); `screen.Match` finds nodes locally. One read per screen state, no element queries.
- The device is used only through `snapshot()`, `tap()`/`tap_point()` (label and point),
  `press_back()` and `_scroll()`, each counted in `commands`. A full round costs 16 commands
  (tests hold it). A screen that differs from the last read is logged at debug level, so the
  log holds every screen of a run.
- Labels come from `app_language.app_languages(config.labels, config.sport)`: Vietnamese from
  `[labels]`, English built in; the utility tapped is the tile of `sport` (`config.SPORTS`,
  `app_language.ENGLISH_SPORTS`) unless `[labels] utility` names one. `prepare()` finds the
  language on the first screen and uses it; a language without a tile for the sport stops the
  run there.
- `prepare()` then tells the account's subdivision (`read_account`) from the apartment code
  on the home screen it read anyway ("BS…" → `bs`, "S…" → `origami`; 0 commands). Only the
  subdivision is logged and reported (`account_subdivision`), never the code (personal data).
  A court the catalog lists in another subdivision is a warning in the log and the Windows
  notification (`cli.AccountSink`), not an error: the guess may be wrong. Any failure there
  only logs.
- Every transition is `tap_and_advance(screen, target, name, find_next)`: tap, then read until
  `find_next` finds the next screen, up to `timeout` (30 s). The tap is repeated every 2 s
  while `target` still shows (a swallowed tap), never while the app loads (target gone).
  Closed loop everywhere: act on what the read shows, never on a fixed delay alone.
- Round: `open_slot` (utility → calendar; a notice in its place, such as the closed-hours one,
  is closed and the utility tapped again until `open_retry_seconds`; a date or slot not listed
  yet reloads the calendar) → `select_date` (the day tapped once clickable, again every
  0.5 s while the calendar's prompt stays) → `select_slot` (tapped once "Tiếp tục" shows
  enabled) → "Tiếp tục" → `_after_calendar` (court list, the venue page, the booking details
  page of a utility with a single court, or a notice, which fails the round at once) →
  `select_court` (or `check_single_court` when a page with one choice passed on to the
  details page by itself: it must name the configured court)
  → "Tiếp tục" → confirmation page → `accept_and_confirm`.
- Venue page (`_venue_entry`): a single venue is tapped whatever its name; of several, the one
  `catalog.py` lists the court under (its name before the line break), else the one naming
  `venue_keyword` (a court typed by hand). A full venue ("Hết chỗ") fails the round at once.
- `catalog.py`: the subdivisions (`origami`, `bs`), their sports in the app's order, venues and
  courts (app name; block, kind and number for the UI's label, the kind one of
  `COURT_KINDS`), from the field notes. The run needs no subdivision: the
  court names its venue. The `subdivision` setting (empty: the account's) only checks the
  settings (`validate_config`: a known subdivision that has the sport).
- A court cut off by the bottom edge is tapped without a swipe: it is in the tree, and the
  driver clicks it by its label (seven basketball courts).
- `select_court`: the court list can move under the tap (field notes), so the booking details
  page must name the configured court; another court is left with Back and tapped again.
- `accept_and_confirm`: tick, then "Xác nhận" at least 0.2 s later. Booked only once the
  ticket's title shows; a notice fails the round (`BookingRejectedError`, `QuotaFullError` when
  it holds the `quota_full` label). "Xác nhận" is tapped again every 3 s while the page still
  shows it enabled; a notice after such a second tap, or nothing within `timeout`, is
  "Outcome unknown" (`BookingUnconfirmedError`). A dry run stops before "Xác nhận".
- Navigation back (`return_to_utilities`, `return_to_home`, `go_back`) presses the next Back as
  soon as the screen before shows; Back is never pressed on the home screen (it leaves the app).
- `book()` returns `Booked`: date, slot and court read on the confirmation page (a difference is
  a warning only) and the ticket's status, from reads the round makes anyway.
- Pure modules (testable without a device): `geometry.py`, `screen.py`, `app_language.py`,
  `catalog.py`,
  most of `clock.py`.

## Events and history

- `events.py`: progress events beside the log lines. `EventKind` values are stable strings
  (database values, UI message keys). `Reporter` swallows sink errors: reporting never costs a
  booking. The CLI emits `run_started`, `device_ready`, `run_finished`; `run_booking` the run's
  steps and `slot_booked`/`slot_failed`; `Booker` the steps of a round.
- `history.py`: `booker.db` (SQLite, WAL, migrations by `PRAGMA user_version`) as an event sink:
  `runs` (with the MuMu instance as `device`, from schema 2; empty for older runs; `court` is
  the configured court until a slot is booked, then the court the app booked), `run_slots`,
  `events`, and the run's log lines (about 0.13 ms per row written). The first database error
  turns history off for the process.
  Schema changes only add columns, so an older runner still writes to a newer database.
- `history_read.py`: read-only queries for the backend (runs, one run, events, the live feed's
  `events_after`, `dry_run_passed`, `account_subdivisions`: the subdivision each
  MuMu instance last told); it migrates an older database first.

## Configuration and data folder

- `config.py`: `load_config` refuses unknown keys but never validates, so an existing config
  never stops the 06:00 run. `validate_config` runs before every save. `save_config` writes
  atomically, without comments, with only the labels that differ from the defaults and the keys
  of `_WRITTEN_WHEN_CHANGED` (and an instance's `sport`) only when changed: an older runner
  refuses keys it does not know.
  New fields go into the dataclass and `config.example.toml`.
- `paths.data_folder()`: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CourtBooker` (`COURT_BOOKER_HOME` overrides) with
  `booker.db`, `run.lock`, `logs/` and the app's `config.toml`. The CLI's config comes from
  `--config`; a relative `log_dir` resolves beside it.
- `device_setup.py`: checks (MuMu installed, MuMu screen settings, wake timers, app installed)
  and `auto_setup` for the fixable ones (`court-booker setup [--auto]`; `GET /api/setup` only
  checks). The screen and the app are checked on every instance (`[[instances]]` too) as one
  item: the worst status, each instance's detail ("MuMu 1: …"); auto setup sets each wrong
  screen. Without a button: `runner.connect_device` finds MuMuManager.exe when the configured
  path is wrong (`find_manager`, the config is not rewritten) and calls `prepare_screen`
  before starting each instance (a stopped MuMu gets 540x1600 at 220 DPI; a running one with
  another screen is only logged, never restarted before the start); `schedule install` and
  `PUT /api/schedule` call `ensure_wake_timers` (`powercfg`).
- `schedule.py`: the Windows task (`schtasks`) that wakes the PC at `wake_at` and runs the
  engine of whatever installed it: the runner folder's Python, or the packaged app.

## Desktop window (`desktop/`)

A Tauri shell around the backend, built by the `Desktop` workflow; the PyInstaller folder
(`packaging/court-booker.spec`, `tools/build_app.py`) is one of its resources. It shows a waiting
page, starts `court-booker.exe serve` without a window, waits for `/api/health` and moves on to the
backend's page. A backend that already answers is used as it is, and only a backend started here
is stopped on leaving. The backend starts from a plain path, without Tauri's `\\?\` prefix, as it
writes its own path into the daily task. It must stay true that nothing about a booking runs in the
window: the daily task runs `court-booker.exe` alone, with the window closed.

## Backend (`court_booker.api`)

`create_app(AppContext)`; `court-booker serve` listens on 127.0.0.1:8765, docs at `/api/docs`.
With a built UI in `court_booker/ui` beside the code, as in the packaged app, it serves that too
(`api/ui.py`), so the window has one origin and needs no CORS: `/api` and the live feed win, and
any other address that is no file answers `index.html`. In development the folder is absent and
Vite serves the UI.
`cli.serve` imports it lazily, so a run never loads FastAPI. Route modules skip
`from __future__ import annotations` and use `Optional` (Python 3.9 evaluates them).
`CourtBookerError`s become `Problem` JSON with an `error` code (409 `lock_held`, 400
`bad_request`, 503 `device`/`app_not_ready`/`notification`/`schedule`, 500 `engine`); invalid
values 422 `invalid_request`.

| Route | Does |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/health` | Version; no device access |
| `GET /api/status` | The Overview in one call: running run (with `runs`: the lock holder's run, then those of the instances it started), schedule, last run, `wake_blocked` (the schedule on but wake timers off: `powercfg`, asked only with no run going on); never calls MuMu |
| `GET /api/runs`, `/api/runs/{id}`, `/api/runs/months` | Runs newest first (filters, paging by id or by days), one run with steps and log lines, months of real bookings |
| `GET /api/events` | Activity steps newest first |
| `GET`/`PUT /api/settings` | Booking settings without the hidden keys (`HIDDEN`: Telegram, the notification), with each `[[instances]]` entry in full; `PUT` validates, refuses added or removed instances, saves only on a change |
| `PUT /api/instances/{mumu_index}` | A machine beside the first on or off: adds its `[[instances]]` table (taking every setting from the top) or removes it; no `enabled` key, which an older runner would refuse |
| `GET`/`PUT /api/notifications`, `POST .../test` | The Windows notification's switch and language; a sample notification |
| `GET /api/setup` | Device checks; nothing is changed (auto setup is the command line's) |
| `GET`/`PUT /api/schedule` | The task: state, times; switching on needs a passed dry run and allows wake timers. Never switch it on from a development backend: the task would run the development Python |
| `POST /api/runs/dry-run` | Starts a dry run in its own process (refused in the quiet time or while a run holds the lock) |
| `GET /api/accounts` | The subdivision each MuMu instance's account told last (`history_read.account_subdivisions`); one the catalog no longer lists is left out |
| `WS /api/live` | Pushes each new step |

After a route, model or catalog change: `python tools/export_openapi.py` (writes
`ui/openapi.json` and `ui/src/catalog.json`), then `npm run api:types`
(`tests/api/test_api_schema.py`, `tests/test_catalog.py` and CI fail until they match).

## UI (`ui/`)

- Vite, React 19, strict TypeScript, ESLint (type-aware), Prettier, Vitest + Testing Library
  (jsdom). Version holds that need Node 22.22 (jsdom 30, React Router 8) are skipped by Dependabot.
- `src/paths.ts` names the one screen and the old addresses that lead to it, keeping
  `?run=`; `routes.tsx` maps them to `pages/`. `i18n/` (Vietnamese
  default, English; same keys, checked by a test). `styles/` holds the tokens (contrast checked
  by `tokens.test.ts`); components use CSS Modules on them.
- `src/api/`: types generated from `openapi.json` (`schema.d.ts`), a typed client, React Query
  hooks (`queries.ts`, `mutations.ts`) and the live feed (`live.ts`, one WebSocket, reconnects
  with `?after=`). Data is refreshed only at run boundaries (`staleKeysFor`): a run's own steps
  send no request, so the UI never slows a booking.
- `steps.ts` words each event kind (a new kind fails the type check); `reasons.ts` turns the
  engine's English reasons into a few words (`notify.REASONS` holds the same words; a test
  compares them).
- One screen (`pages/HomePage.tsx`, parts in `pages/home/`): the ticket (`BookingTicket`:
  on top the daily switch and what is set: the play day and court side by side, the slots
  on a row of their own (fixed rows, whatever the court's name), and a line only while the
  switch is off, for the machine chosen on its tabs on top (`MachineBar`, "Máy 1", "Máy 2":
  one per MuMu instance, always two at least: without `[[instances]]` the second is MuMu 1,
  switched off and pale; a red mark on a machine that books with setup of its own left),
  following each press as its save goes out; under the perforation, on a machine beside the
  first, its "Dùng máy này" switch (`PUT /api/instances/{mumu_index}`), then, while it
  books, that machine's subdivision, sport, court and up to two slots, saved on each press,
  and the dry run;
  or `LiveTicket` while a booking or a dry run goes on: one ticket per run of `running.runs`,
  named "MuMu N" when several instances book side by side) and `SidePanel` beside it, two tabs:
  `HistoryTab` (runs ten days at a time, real bookings unless dry runs are ticked, `?run=`
  opens one run's slots, steps and log) and `SetupTab` (the user's ticks and the guide,
  those of the machine chosen on the ticket, which `HomePage` holds).
  The result notification's switch (`NotifySwitch`) sits on the ticket beside the daily one, both with a short word ("Tự đặt", "Thông báo") and their full name for screen
  readers. The header's status line (`components/StatusLine.tsx`)
  shows the run going on, else the one thing to do. `machines.ts` lists the machines from the
  settings. `manualSteps.ts` keeps the user's ticks in `localStorage` (memory when storage
  fails): MuMu's once, the app's and the login's for each machine; `setupState.ts` counts the
  setup tasks left over the machines that book and picks the panel's first tab. `booking.ts` holds the slots and the two-slot limit, and reads
  the subdivisions, sports and courts from `catalog.json`, written from `catalog.py`.
  `useFormat`'s `courtLabel` tells a court from the others of its sport ("BE7 · tập ném 01",
  in English "BE7 · shooting 01": the app keeps court names in Vietnamese in both languages,
  so the kind's words are in `courtKinds` of the language files) and `court` adds the sport
  ("Tennis S6"). The ticket's subdivision is the one the settings
  name, else the one the account told last (`GET /api/accounts`, refreshed when a run ends,
  "Theo tài khoản"), else Origami; pressing one saves it, keeps the sport if the subdivision
  has it (else its first sport) and takes the first court. The UI never calls `GET /api/setup` or
  `POST /api/notifications/test` (the routes stay for the command line and tools).

## Driver (`android/`)

An instrumentation APK (`dev.courtbooker.driver`), started with `am instrument`. It uses
UiAutomation, like uiautomator2, so only one of them runs at a time; it is not an
accessibility service, which the app refuses (field notes). `tools/build_driver.py` builds it
with the SDK tools into `src/court_booker/assets/court-driver.apk` (committed; a test fails
when the sources change without a rebuild). `driver.py` installs it when its SHA-256 differs,
forwards a port and talks to it; no answer within 10 s per command is
`DeviceNotRespondingError`.

Protocol 1, one JSON object per line each way (`op`, arguments, optional `id`; the reply has
`ok`, `error`):

| `op` | Does |
|---|---|
| `hello` | `protocol`, `version`, `sdk` |
| `dump` | The window as uiautomator2's XML (visible nodes, bounds clipped) |
| `click` `label x y` | Clicks the node labelled `label` nearest (x, y) where it is now (`ACTION_CLICK`, else a touch at its middle); `clicked` false when gone |
| `click_at` `x y` | The same for the smallest clickable node at (x, y): unlabelled elements |
| `back`, `swipe x1 y1 x2 y2 ms` | Injected key or touch |
| `current` | Package of the active window |
| `stop` | Ends the driver |

## Tests

- External effects are injectable; nothing in the suite touches a device, adb, the network,
  Task Scheduler, MuMu or PowerShell. `tests/conftest.py` points `COURT_BOOKER_HOME` at a
  temporary folder.
- `tests/test_flow.py`: `FakeApp`, a scripted app (screens as node lists, taps and Back switch
  screens), with a fake clock; `in_english` turns it English. A full round costs 16 commands.
- Backend tests are in `tests/api/` (skipped without FastAPI); UI tests sit beside the code.
